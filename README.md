# PasswordObfuscator
A program that takes in your password and randomizes it using the most commonly accepted password characters

I have been learning some Java for a class that I am currently taking in my Masters program, and was curious to know what
the fastest way to learn the basics of Java. 

As such, I was interested in how my BitWarden Server would offer me passwords that are at times acceptable/unacceptable,
due to the nature of the characters being used. To remedy this, I built my own password obfuscator and thought to write it 
in Java for ease of access and portability. If a device that I were to use has JVM installed in it, then its just a matter
of running the program. Now I have a basic security feature that works for all most all profiles.
